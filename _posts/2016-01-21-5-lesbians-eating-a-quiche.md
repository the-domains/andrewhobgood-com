The year is 1956 and the Susan B. Anthony Society for the Sisters of Gertrude Stein is meeting for their annual quiche breakfast. However, this year there is an unexpected agenda item -- the dropping of atom bombs on their fair city. This normally idyllic gathering is upended when the Society's matriarchs must confront some startling revelations made by the Sisterhood while meeting the fallout from the Red Menace head on.

An Uptown Chicago loft becomes a breeding ground for young minds looking to change the world. Self-identified geniuses, cyber-vigilantes, hacktivists and anarchists cast off the laws of the land as they attempt to alter Humanity's fate. As these Millennials plot against enemies and build complex data schemes,_reWILDing Genius_asks how far is too far in our quest to save us from ourselves.

**Part of Steppenwolf's Garage Rep 2014**

_reWILDing Genius was initially developed in residency with The Theater and Performance Studies program at the University of Chicago and was given a workshop premiere at the Logan Center for the Arts, April 2013\._

A concept album from 1963 within a stage play within a live performance, That Sordid Little Story mixes modern American story-telling devices with the traditions of Greek theatre to craft a hilarious and heart-wrenching tale of a boy in search of his past. Upon hearing the first tracks on the new album by the band "That Sordid Little Story," Billy realizes that they have written the story of his life, thus far, in song. His quest leads him to travel the American Bible Belt in hopes of finding the band, and ultimately the whereabouts of his father. As he stumbles along, his journey begins to shape the rest of the album. But is he a slave to his own fate or really its master?

One Child, One Nation may have saved our great country during the population crisis 50 years ago but The New Colony and Bailiwick Chicago have heard the voices of its victims. You've heard the rumors of the secret Numberless performance troupe but we found them. They are no terrorists. Let your underground brothers and sisters open your eyes with their glam-rock inspired RISE OF THE NUMBERLESS. This is treason but this is truth. Only child? Think again.
