# Rise of The Numberless

**_Type: Musical_**

**__**

One Child, One Nation may have saved our great country during the population crisis 50 years ago but The New Colony and Bailiwick Chicago have heard the voices of its victims. You've heard the rumors of the secret Numberless performance troupe but we found them. They are no terrorists. Let your underground brothers and sisters open your eyes with their glam-rock inspired RISE OF THE NUMBERLESS. This is treason but this is truth. Only child? Think again.
