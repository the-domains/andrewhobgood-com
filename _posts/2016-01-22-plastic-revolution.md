# Plastic Revolution

**_Type: Musical, Comedy_**

When recently widowed Delores Clarke meets Tupperware pioneer Brownie Wise, a new phenomenon sweeps through their picturesque 1950s Kissimee, FL neighborhood. Selling a few hours of independence to local women with a revolutionary plastic craze, they tackle social norms, small-town politics and change the face of the American dinner table forever.
