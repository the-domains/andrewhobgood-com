The year is 1956 and the Susan B. Anthony Society for the Sisters of Gertrude Stein is meeting for their annual quiche breakfast. However, this year there is an unexpected agenda item -- the dropping of atom bombs on their fair city. This normally idyllic gathering is upended when the Society's matriarchs must confront some startling revelations made by the Sisterhood while meeting the fallout from the Red Menace head on.

> - Charleston City Paper

> "The raucously off-kilter humor never obscures the more serious grace notes and sub-texts...It is silly, it is rude, it is laugh-out-loud funny, and it's all over too soon."   
> - Atlanta Theater Buzz

> ★★★★★ (out of five) "The bitingly funny story of friendship, pastry and forbidden love has the audience in stitches."   
> - Vancouver Sun
