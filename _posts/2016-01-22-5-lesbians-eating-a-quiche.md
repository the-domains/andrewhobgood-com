The year is 1956 and the Susan B. Anthony Society for the Sisters of Gertrude Stein is meeting for their annual quiche breakfast. However, this year there is an unexpected agenda item -- the dropping of atom bombs on their fair city. This normally idyllic gathering is upended when the Society's matriarchs must confront some startling revelations made by the Sisterhood while meeting the fallout from the Red Menace head on.

> - Ben Brantley, The New York Times

> ★★★★ (out of five) "A cult hit...gleaming with comic polish."   
> - Time Out New York

> "A delectable portrait of sublimated Sapphism...\[5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche\] dishes up high-spirited theatrical comfort food with a bit of a saucy kick."   
> - Chicago Tribune

> "By and large, 5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche's strengths lay in the script...Linder and Hobgood weave clever punch lines throughout the plot, anchoring the seemingly absurd premise. True Genius!"   
> - Charleston City Paper

> "The raucously off-kilter humor never obscures the more serious grace notes and sub-texts...It is silly, it is rude, it is laugh-out-loud funny, and it's all over too soon."   
> - Atlanta Theater Buzz

> ★★★★★ (out of five) "The bitingly funny story of friendship, pastry and forbidden love has the audience in stitches."   
> - Vancouver Sun
