# reWILDing Genius

**_Type: Play_**

An Uptown Chicago loft becomes a breeding ground for young minds looking to change the world. Self-identified geniuses, cyber-vigilantes, hacktivists and anarchists cast off the laws of the land as they attempt to alter Humanity's fate. As these Millennials plot against enemies and build complex data schemes,_reWILDing Genius_asks how far is too far in our quest to save us from ourselves.

**Part of Steppenwolf's Garage Rep 2014**

_reWILDing Genius was initially developed in residency with The Theater and Performance Studies program at the University of Chicago and was given a workshop premiere at the Logan Center for the Arts, April 2013\._
