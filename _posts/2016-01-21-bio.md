# Bio

Andrew Hobgood is the Founding Artistic Director of The New Colony, the Business Strategist for Vosges Chocolate, and an Adjunct Professor of Theater at the University of Chicago. 

His last play, 5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche, won Outstanding Production at the 2012 New York International Fringe Festival before opening as an Off-Broadway production that Ben Brantley of the New York Times called "raw and magnetic dementia...destined to attract a cult following." 5 Lesbians is now published with Samuel French. 

Hobgood's other work with The New Colony includes writing and directing the new musicals Tupperware: An American Musical Fable, That Sordid Little Story, and Rise of The Numberless. His directing credits for The New Colony include Amelia Earhart: Jungle Princess, the original and commercial productions of FRAT, Hearts Full of Blood, which won Outstanding Script at the 2010 New York International Fringe Festival, and most recently B-Side Studio, produced in collaboration with The Inconvenience and the University of Chicago TAPS program. 

In 2010, Newcity Magazine named him one of the 50 People Who Really Perform for Chicago; in 2011, he and The New Colony were honored with the Broadway in Chicago Emerging Theater Award; and in 2013 he and Co-Artistic Director Evan Linder were two of six people on Chicago Magazine's Cultural Power List of Theater Scene Stealers. 

His new play reWILDing Genius was commissioned by the University of Chicago. 

When not directing, writing or acting, he can be found working in the Innovation Lab of Vosges Haut-Chocolat, or guest speaking and writing on the topics of Devised/Collaborative Theater, the future of playwrighting and theater, and the Art of Business/Business of Art.
